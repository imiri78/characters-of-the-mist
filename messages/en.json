         "about": "#### What is Characters of the Mist?\n\nCharacters of the Mist is an **unofficial**, fan-made character creator and manager for the TTRPGs from [Amit Moshe and Son of Oak Game Studio LLC](https://cityofmist.co). It's built from the ground up with a modern and responsive design, and all your data is saved directly in your browser for complete privacy and control. This tool is in no way endorsed by Amit Moshe or Son of Oak Game Studio LLC.\n\n---\n\n#### What can this tool do?\n\nThis tool is meant to help you create and update your character sheet quickly and easily. It allows you to edit your Theme Cards, Statuses, and Name, and save everything automatically. Beyond the basics, it's packed with powerful features to make managing your character a breeze:\n\n* A versatile **Drawer** that acts like a complete file system for your character components, with full drag-and-drop organization and a compact view for managing many items.\n\n* Intuitive **drag-and-drop** for almost everything: reorder your cards and trackers, move items between folders, or even load an entire character by dragging it from the drawer.\n\n* A fully **dynamic character sheet** with flexible cards. You can even switch to a **side-by-side view** if you prefer to see the front and back of cards at the same time.\n\n* A powerful **Undo & Redo system** (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y`) that will allow you to fix your mistakes whether they happened in the Drawer or on your Character Sheet.\n\n* A **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`) that lets you find and use any feature in the app without touching your mouse.\n\n* **Game-related personalization** with multiple color themes assorted to Mist TTRPGs and a light/dark mode toggle to make the app feel like your own.\n\n---\n\n#### Can this tool be used as a VTT?\n\nAs it is right now, this tool is only a character manager. It doesn't support battlemaps, handouts, dice rollers or further automatization. You are free to fork this project and add those features, as long as the license terms are respected.\n\n---\n\n#### Can I report a problem with the app?\n\nYou can send me a message on [the official Tools of the Mist discord](https://discord.gg/c7GBPyTcWW) should you encounter a problem with the app, and I will see what I can do about it.
